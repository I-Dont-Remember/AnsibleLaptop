auto update vscode https://askubuntu.com/questions/833448/how-to-update-vs-code-on-ubuntu
- Is it worth having a single top-level config file of variables? would it help us
keep things more up to date?




***** IDEAS ********
- instead of become true, run the whole thing as root

- Have plan for when to run apt-get update and apt-get upgrade

- Most of our stuff is in dotfiles, docker, and web browsers.  Especially if we move
to docker development.  Spend most time making sure all that is setup.

- convert docker to docker_install, then have a separate role for docker setup and stuff
--use http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/docker_module.html docker ansible module for 
development setup
set docker install location in home rather than filling root, should do with a lot of software

really should check for distro, then we can have it package manager/distro agnostic.
Then if we want to try CentOS or an Arch based distro or whatever in the future we set.

had to add "org.gradle.daemon=true" in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties to allow react native to use gradle





playbooks should be the main configuration details, not roles like we currently have
- Want to be able to run against any debian/ubuntu derivative, so need to write it in a way that is conducive
- Should be able to choose to run against desktop or laptop with no issue
- Should be able to setup raspberry pi or home server with everything we need
- roles can be passed values (like commands), could be useful
- handlers are used when other tasks report changes, such as restarting services
