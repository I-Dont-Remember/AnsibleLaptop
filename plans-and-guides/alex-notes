(08:07:52 AM) Alex Politowicz: Overall, looks pretty good except for a few minor things that I noticed may help improve workflow. Generally, I find it easier to use other roles through meta files. So for example, in your kubuntu-laptop.yml under roles, I would only put laptop. Then, in a roles/laptop/meta/main.yml file you could put the following:--- 
dependencies: 
 - { role: kubuntu } 
  - { role: laptop }

  (08:08:06 AM) Alex Politowicz: *there are dashed in front of those role blocks
  (08:08:31 AM) Alex Politowicz: Sorry! Disregard previous copy-paste
  (08:11:09 AM) Alex Politowicz: --- 
  dependencies: 
   - { role: common } 
    - { role: kubuntu }

    (08:13:23 AM) Alex Politowicz: On a side note. I'm not too sure if this is what you were going for, but running apt: update_cache only runs "sudo apt-get update" so ideally you would run that before the package installs (again, assuming that's what you intended)
    (08:13:33 AM) Alex Politowicz: Otherwise, looks cool!
