auto update vscode https://askubuntu.com/questions/833448/how-to-update-vs-code-on-ubuntu
- Is it worth having a single top-level config file of variables? would it help us
keep things more up to date?




***** IDEAS ********
- instead of become true, run the whole thing as root

- Have plan for when to run apt-get update and apt-get upgrade

- Most of our stuff is in dotfiles, docker, and web browsers.  Especially if we move
to docker development.  Spend most time making sure all that is setup.

- convert docker to docker_install, then have a separate role for docker setup and stuff
--use http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/docker_module.html docker ansible module for 
development setup
set docker install location in home rather than filling root, should do with a lot of software

really should check for distro, then we can have it package manager/distro agnostic.
Then if we want to try CentOS or an Arch based distro or whatever in the future we set.

playbooks should be the main configuration details, not roles like we currently have
- Want to be able to run against any debian/ubuntu derivative, so need to write it in a way that is conducive
- Should be able to choose to run against desktop or laptop with no issue
- Should be able to setup raspberry pi or home server with everything we need
- roles can be passed values (like commands), could be useful
- handlers are used when other tasks report changes, such as restarting services


For being able to handle multiple distros/ OS's from the same playbook:
!!"For example, it is common practice to have platform-specific tasks included from the tasks/main.yml file"!
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html
"
# roles/example/tasks/main.yml
- name: added in 2.4, previously you used 'include'
  import_tasks: redhat.yml
  when: ansible_facts['os_family']|lower == 'redhat'
- import_tasks: debian.yml
  when: ansible_facts['os_family']|lower == 'debian'

# roles/example/tasks/redhat.yml
- yum:
    name: "httpd"
    state: present

# roles/example/tasks/debian.yml
- apt:
    name: "apache2"
    state: present

"
^^ this seems like the normal way to handle different distros while keeping the playbook the same

# *************** IS IT WORTH IT?? ********************8
Is Ansible worth the effort versus having a variety of bash scripts or 
or things stored around? If we start spending more time working in Vim our dotfiles
take up more and more of this project.  Spend some time thinking this through before
spending lots of time on it.

* We will probably be forced to use Macs for the foreseable future at work no matter what company,
come up with our bootstrap version so we can get up and running real fast each time.
