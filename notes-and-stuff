***** IDEAS ********
- instead of become true, run the whole thing as root

- Have plan for when to run apt-get update and apt-get upgrade

- Most of our stuff is in dotfiles, docker, and web browsers.  Especially if we move
to docker development.  Spend most time making sure all that is setup.

- convert docker to docker_install, then have a separate role for docker setup and stuff
--use http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/docker_module.html docker ansible module for 
development setup

- web browsers: can have opera, chrome, brave, and firefox for a variety.

*********** Additions ********************
ssh config - http://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/
ssh keys
bashrc, profile, etc
vimrc
- alteration of efibootmgr, use the thing where it halts and lets user deal with input
pip, virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper
VPN
cron jobs
set docker install location in home rather than filling root, should do with a lot of software

### NFS setup ###
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nfs-mount-on-ubuntu-16-04
nfs-kernel-server installed on host
nfs-common installed on client


 - setup exports in host /etc/exports and restart server
 - * nfs needs uid/gid to match for it to allow usage as non-sudo, 
     current workaround is /etc/nfs.map file:
# remote local
gid 1001 1000 # theuser kquinn
uid 1001 1000
 - Allows usage as oddly 'theuser uid 1000' whereas 'kevin uid 1001' was the goal.
     yes, tried flipping and it didn't work.
     This setup allows me permissions in any directories/files created by kevin user, 
     so somehow permissions on machine must allow theuser to access kevin stuff.
     No bueno but I don't care right now.
  - fstab is working now? i guess


really should check for distro, then we can have it package manager/distro agnostic.
   Then if we want to try CentOS or an Arch based distro or whatever in the future we set.
